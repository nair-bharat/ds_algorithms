/*


Ugly nos are those nos which are prime factors of 2,3 and 5 i.e

they are : 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15,....................

if 10 is a no given, then we can write it as 2X5 and here 2 and 5 are present

if 14, then 2 X 7 here 7 cannot be written as factors as factors of 2,3 or 5
11 is not an ugly no because it cannot be written

It can be implemented using  both brute force and dynamic programming
